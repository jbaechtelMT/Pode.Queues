# Pode.Queues

I wrote <strong>Pode.Queues</strong> to be a compainion module for use with <strong><a href="https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode">Pode</a></strong> & <strong><a href="https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode.Web">Pode.Web</a></strong> projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you that don't know about these projects, I have found them to be the best PowerShell based web server and API delivery platform to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should really take a look!

This module was born out of my need to have communication and control between multiple PowerShell runspaces, and the need for User to User communications mechinisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to write my scripts/APIs to be utilitarian where one script/page can call on another script/API to perform needed functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask, "If it is an API, couldn't you just issue a REST API call to the API?"&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is: Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;But why not do those API calls in memory instead of passing it through the NIC?&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention, how would you handle Control commands to the APIs as "Interrupts" or "Events"?&nbsp;&nbsp;This module provides those abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, what about wanting your site users to have the ability to coummicate between themselves, or having the ability for the site itself to be able to message a single user or broadcast a message to all users.&nbsp;&nbsp;Say something like the site notifing all users that it is about to restart itself so that the users have warning enough to save their work?&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can!

Pode is a Cross-Platform framework for creating web servers to host [REST APIs](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Routes/Overview/), [Web Pages](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Routes/Examples/WebPages/), and [SMTP/TCP](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Servers/) Servers. Pode also allows you to render dynamic files using [`.pode`](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Views/Pode/) files, which are just embedded PowerShell, or other [Third-Party](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Views/ThirdParty/) template engines. Plus many more features, including [Azure Functions](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Hosting/AzureFunctions/) and [AWS Lambda](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Hosting/AwsLambda/) support!

See [here](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Getting-Started/FirstApp) for building your first app! Don't know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? No problem! [Pode.Web](https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode.Web) is currently a work in progress, and lets you build web pages using purely PowerShell!

## üìò Documentation

All documentation and tutorials for Pode can be [found here](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode) - this documentation will be for the latest release.

To see the docs for other releases, branches or tags, you can host the documentation locally. To do so you'll need to have the [`InvokeBuild`](https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build) module installed; then:
